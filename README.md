`sense` rates phrases for double meanings.

## Usage

> How do I run `sense`?

1. Open the terminal.

1. Make a `.yaml` config file named `fat.yaml` in the current directory.

   ```yaml
   benchmark: "on one's plate"
   theme: "fat"
   ```

1. Run the command with your configuration file.

   ```bash
   sense fat.yaml
   ```

Once the API batches finish, `sense` will drop two files into your current directory:

- fat.tsv: a file that contains normalized scores

- fat.json: a file that contains raw scores
