> How do I set up `sense`?

1. Make sure you're using a Mac with Apple silicon.

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/#install).

1. Install [devenv](https://github.com/cachix/devenv/blob/83e8d7d34bdebad98ab936b6af53d57ae67af420/docs/src/getting-started.md#installation).

1. Open a terminal.

1. Copy an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys).

1. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/sense/
   pbpaste > ~/.config/sense/key
   git clone https://github.com/8ta4/sense
   cd sense
   devenv allow
   download
   ```

## Usage

> How do I run `sense`?

1. Open a terminal.

1. Make a YAML config file like this in the current directory.

   ```yaml
   benchmark: "on one's plate"
   theme: "fat"
   ```

1. Run the command with your configuration file.

   ```bash
   sense fat.yaml
   ```

Once the API batches finish, `sense` will drop two files into your current directory:

- fat.tsv: a file that contains normalized scores

- fat.json: a file that contains raw scores
